You build your base, join or create a clan, attack other bases and clans, and have fun! It's a simple premise but it's enjoyable. One thing I will say is you have to be very patient or one that has a lot of time on their hands as when it comes to builds and upgrades the more you build and upgrade, eventually the time duration for each upgrade increases from minutes to hours to even days. Overall, fun simple game. Would recommend.\", \"You guys should really add shovels to the free battle pass. Especially considering there was a long period of time when we had to completely delete special items off of our bases to make room for buildings, defenses, etc., before we were ever even offered an option to make them movable items. And if you're far along in the game and have a bunch of special items on your base that you're trying to keep, as I am, then it's far too few and inbetween where one is able to get shovels to do so.\", 'Whatever happened with the last update messed up attacks. I am in the top tier and only get 8 attacks per day. Twice in a row I have had an error when I try to attack. It says I am out of sync with the server and forces me to reload the game. I am uninstalling and reinstalling the game to see if that fixes the issue', \"Takes time to get far, but that's the fun of it. You wait for something to finish while playing another aspect of the game. It doesn't force you into anything, and it eases you into the game. Important tip, DONT RUSH YOUR BASE. Wait until everything is upgraded before you upgrade your town hall. This is really important because if your defenses are extremely low level people can easily 3 star you and steal all the loot you got.\", \"The way trophies work in the builder base needs to be reworked. I just spent an hour attacking bases and only earned around 40 to 50 trophies. I can earn 30 to 50 trophies an attack, but the enemy can do the same as well. It's hard to move up to different levels when you are only earning a couple of trophies at a time.\", \"It is perfect, except for the builder base. the whole reason a lot of people liked it was because it was different from the home base, different wall types, different troop types, but now its just exactly the same as the home base, with a few minor tweaks. BUT I love how this game does not pay to win, it's pay to progress, so you can get just as good as someone else who spent money, they just will be in a higher league for a while. But there are NO ads, whatsoever.\", \"Will always be Supercell's best game. Can never truly step away from it. Sure, it can get boring and slow at times, but for 2-3 years of free to play, you'll always have something to do. If you buy just some small deals here and there, it makes it a game you can play more frequently. I log in maybe twice a day just to attack and upgrade and always passes the time.\", \"Hi Devs! Please consider creating a feature to have saved clan castle reinforcements so you don't have to delete the previous troops because of a change in attack strategy. Also it would be nice to see a change in the wall placing system. Anytime you try and move a wall segment, it swaps the pieces and makes it really frustrating to move wall segments.\", \"Lovely game, there's enough stuff to be able to spend a ton of time, but you can also just pop in, change something, and pop out. The game is definitely way too long nowadays, if you are picking this up as a new player don't expect to ever finish it, but CoC had its peak time. There needs to be new content for the maxed players, but I think that adding more town hall levels is just absurd with how long the game is already.\", \"An amazing game where you progress through different town halls whilst unlocking new troops, spells, and buildings. The only complaint I have is once you get to around town hall 12 the time it takes to upgrade things is way to much. It makes the game a lot less fun because your mostly waiting. But other than that its a great strategy game and I highly recommend it to anyone who's into strategy! 😆\", \"The builder base is garbage. It was great playing much like the regular base, but making you be a little more tactical and precise with your attacks. Now supercell really dropped the ball redesigning the way it's played. The mechanics of it feel just disgusting now. Adding a second stage and more to it is great, but why did they have to change the way it was played. I love clash, and hopefully enough passionate players feel the same about the new update, and they fix what they just screwed up.\", \"The new Builder's Hall part of the game is cool. But it takes soooo long to match with an attack. It reminds me of dial-up internet access. 🤦🏼 It often takes longer to find you an opponent than it does to complete the attacks. Seems to maybe be my connection through WiFi. When switched to cellular, selection is faster.\", \"This game has been with me sence about 2013 yet with my current device, which yes, has a low-ish storage space, but nonetheless I have to remove several apps just to install updates. As well as, every single time I've attacked another base I'd get maybe two stars into the fight then the game will crash it is insane that I've had to go through this process, I cannot attack at all, it's very hard to understand why this process happens all the time. Thank you.\", \"This is an easy 5 star. This game has been one of my favorite games for years. It's so exciting because you just feel the action and destruction everytime you attack a village or in a war. I never get bored of this, although upgrading defenses and walls is extremely difficult and expensive, it's still a very interesting and fantastic experience. The most relaxing and satsfying thing is that it has ZERO ads, which is really amazing and relaxing for me not to try skipping any ad.\", 'No forced ads. There is a gem system, and you can pay for it, but you can earn gyms passively and consistently through achievements and clearing bushes from your base. The battles are fun, and you are constantly upgrading your base and characters. They added a second base (builder base) with a slightly different and faster paced playstyle as well. The only negative thing I can say is that the game feels a bit easy now as opposed to 10 years ago when i used to play, still solid game though 5*', \"Is there anyway that players could get a landscape design without spending cash. Like some challenges or X amount of gems. I really wanted to have sceneries but since I'm still a student, i can't buy. But still, issues are fixed and there's so much things you could do now while in game. Good graphics still and new heroes, potions, and buildings. Hope to reduce building time because some buildings took weeks to finish..\", \"Super Goblins were the best addition to the game, providing players, who aren't as good strategically, to advance in their own way. In the same way, the new builder base update destroyed the simplicity of the attacking system. I was playing it dailly using the cannon carts and slowly but steadily making progress. After the update, I got the 9 star bonus once and probably won't play again, until it is changed in a way, that let's me enjoy playing it again. Sometimes less is more!!!\", 'Overall, the game is pretty good, i have been playing it for about 2-3 years now, but im starting to lose interest in it cause of how long the upgrading mechanic takes, most of the time the upgrades are about 2 - 1 week long, and is there any way we can unlock the sceneries without spending money? Like maybe a event or something. Overall, a pretty good game but not reccomended for people who are impatient.', \"I've been playing Clash for the better part of 11 years now and I absolutely love the game. Everything from the mechanics to the aesthetic. I do have one major issue that seems to have been cropping up recently. 95% of the time my Electro Dragons turn away from the enemy's Town Hall, and right infront of it too, costing me stars and trophies. It was never an issue before the release of the Stage Battles were brought out for Builder Base. Please look into and fix this bug.\", \"It's a pretty good game and I've been playing it for so long. There was never anything wrong with the game except for longer upgrade time at higher town Hall's which is to be expected. But recently, whenever I play the game, sometimes, while attacking opponents, the zoom in and zoom out gestures gets reversed and I am not able to deploy the troops. It lasts for only for a few seconds, but in games like COC, few seconds can lead to many changes\", \"Played in 2015 till 2017. Got away from the game because it became too repititive and boring, on top of that, the cost and upgrade time was too much. Played again in 2020 for a while and noticed a lot of improvement but stopped at the same year due to busy with work. Played again now in 2023 and absolutely love all the addition, improvement and upgrades to the game. Now addicted again. Love how the game is not pay to win and it's optional if you want to improve your experience through cash.\", 'I had a great experience playing the game. However, last update completely overhauled the interface design... Now i cannot see the maximum possible update of buildings in the main town... i used that information to plan how investing ressources, but now i cannot would really love if you could add it to the new interface.', 'Enjoyable but... Building take so long to build it\\'s forcing you to spend money, which isn\\'t an issue but to become \\'the best\\' you are required to spend a fair bit of cash, which isn\\'t great... Maybe some sort of month subscription could be introduced which give you \"X amount of times for a month\" and you can still purchase more on top if you wished too. Overall it\\'s a good game if patient enough to build your clan on a cheaper budget.', \"Font size got decreased alot,, do need increase it. As I am playing it's not looking good with smaller fonts. And one more suggestion, please do not make anything extra bases in the game as it's getting more confusing and we feel like what we need to play...nd consuming lot of storage also, this will lead me to un install the game as I am playing since 5 years..\", \"I've been trying to buy a cheap pack (to avoid waiting on the game) for hours! Wfter jumping through loops and registering a code word to my credit card, finally bought (twice, as it's very easy to mistakenly make a double purchase) I'm still unable to get my pack!!!!. Still 'waiting', nobody to help or to answer! Horrible frustrating experience!!!!!!\", 'Been playing on and off for the last few years. Very little has changed. Same characters, same stuff to do, but nice game to burn time. Only drawback is that it would be great if there were templates to use for base design instead of having to design your own. Really becomes a pain when you get over level 8.', \"The play experience of the same itself, that is very, very good I would rate 5 stars if that was the only thing I was going off. But as fun as this game is. After just 1 minute of playtime the game just goes black. nothing on my screen except black, and the only way I can keep playing is by restarting the game. If this issue is fixed then I'll update my review to 5 stars. Edit: It was fixed. Thankyou Supercell, now you get 5 stars from me.\", \"Clash of Clans is a fun, quite addicting game that really takes a lot of time and effort but has fast paced, strategic battle elements. If you can either ignore of bear with long waiting times for upgrades or building, I highly recommend this game. If you can't deal with those, this game maybe isn't for you, unless you think the game makes up for it in the battle and village defence. I think it's worth at least trying the tutorial, as it's very short and gives you a decent overview of the game.\", 'Logged in today after a long time. The new events and stuff are really good. But right after logging in I have encountered 2 problems. While trying to login using supercell account it often takes too long to send verification code. The more annoying thing is the new button adjustments in upgrades. Why did you add \"confirm magic items\" instead of the resources option first thing after clicking upgrade. I was trying to upgrade my walls and instead of resources used up walls rings accidentally.', 'This game is way too good! Has nice graphics and is a really fun strategy game. I love how you actually need to use your brain and thinking but you only have 30 seconds to brain storm before the battle starts. Really nice idea. Also I just love the amount of updates and content that this game puts out. It even has its own show! And the advertising is great! This game is definitely a 10 out of 10.', \"The update a few months ago fixed the crashing issues. I almost gave up. You guys fixed it at the last minute, I was so excited. I was back to playing this game daily and spending money. Well the upgrade yesterday just made it start crashing. I'm disappointed, had it perfect. Now I'm debating getting ride of my account I have had since 2015. Nothing worse that the game crashing mid war or battle. All them millions and still cant figure it out. Put me on the payroll. I would fix week 1 smh\", 'It is a very good game to play Where we need to build our base to protect from enemies and you can also attack on the enemy base but first you need to train your troops. Whenever you level up there is a new class of adventure. It becomes more and more interesting when you level up. And there are clans where you can join and attack together with your clan members.', \"Application crashes all the time especially when I click on attack in Legend League. When not in Legend league, finding opponents was taking more than 5 minutes of loading. Developers are slacking or what?, I don't even get my missed attacks back. Add some backend cron job to look for such failures to give me my attack counts back.\", \"The main game is fun and they have made it alot better over the years. The builder base wich is separate from the main base is wildly unbalanced. It feels like it's impossible to get gold. Even if you miraculously 3 Star a base it only gives a measly amount of gold. You have to grind so much for 1 upgrade and attacking is so hard because the tiny amount of troops you are allowed to bring die so fast to the defenses. So actually 3 staring a base is rare, at least at the lower levels.\", 'This game is so much fun and interesting. The attack strategies, gaming system everything is awesome. But sometimes my screen turn black. The game is on, sound, touch everything but the screen turn black. Nowadays it is happening frequently when I enter the game. If you see into this matter it would be great I think.', 'The best strategic game , needs great planning , execution , reflexes and skillz , really love this game , new builder base update is just awsome!! , please make the magic items to become available a tad more easy and reduce upgrade amount for heroes a bit , upgrade timer for heroes is not much of a matter of concern but that amount...especially at higher town hall levels', \"I'm back from a 2 to 3 year hiatus. I've noticed you don't need elixir to train troops anymore. I feel as if it defeats the purpose of the game. Now, managing your base is easier than ever. Striving for gold to upgrade something really expensive was the fun part. Everything is more or less handed to you on a silver platter.\", \"Very Nice👍 It's fun, but you could actually add some new features like day to night transition. Yk, it's always day. What you could do is that you could add an afternoon phase with that yellowish orange afternoon light, and add a nighttime, which might require some different tasks. Also the production buildings and materials get sooooo expensive at a point, it makes us lose interest.\", \"Pretty good game. But no way should 1 upgrade take a week, that's absolutely ridiculous. Personally it makes me lose interest in the game entirely. Especially when you level up and placed in a new bracket, now you're facing people whom have their bases maxed out. To compete with them you either wait a year or whip out your visa. Also it seems like troops try to attack anything but the base, even if they're directly in front of it.\", \"I really enjoy the game it's fun and unique but sadly a game can't be perfect 😔 the walls can be too expensive not to mention the long hours or days you have to wait. I really don't have a problem waiting but it becomes a little annoying when you have to wait 5 or 6 day for one upgrade. I suggest you make builders potion more common or reduce the amount of time it takes to finish an upgrade. Other than that i really thank the developers for giving us such a good game, 5⭐\"], 'appId': 'com.supercell.clashofclans', 'url': 'https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.supercell.clashofclans&hl=en&gl=us'}\n"

You build your base, join or create a clan, attack other bases and clans, and have fun! It's a simple premise but it's enjoyable. One thing I will say is you have to be very patient or one that has a lot of time on their hands as when it comes to builds and upgrades the more you build and upgrade, eventually the time duration for each upgrade increases from minutes to hours to even days. Overall, fun simple game. Would recommend.\", \"You guys should really add shovels to the free battle pass. Especially considering there was a long period of time when we had to completely delete special items off of our bases to make room for buildings, defenses, etc., before we were ever even offered an option to make them movable items. And if you're far along in the game and have a bunch of special items on your base that you're trying to keep, as I am, then it's far too few and inbetween where one is able to get shovels to do so.\", 'Whatever happened with the last update messed up attacks. I am in the top tier and only get 8 attacks per day. Twice in a row I have had an error when I try to attack. It says I am out of sync with the server and forces me to reload the game. I am uninstalling and reinstalling the game to see if that fixes the issue', \"Takes time to get far, but that's the fun of it. You wait for something to finish while playing another aspect of the game. It doesn't force you into anything, and it eases you into the game. Important tip, DONT RUSH YOUR BASE. Wait until everything is upgraded before you upgrade your town hall. This is really important because if your defenses are extremely low level people can easily 3 star you and steal all the loot you got.\", \"The way trophies work in the builder base needs to be reworked. I just spent an hour attacking bases and only earned around 40 to 50 trophies. I can earn 30 to 50 trophies an attack, but the enemy can do the same as well. It's hard to move up to different levels when you are only earning a couple of trophies at a time.\", \"It is perfect, except for the builder base. the whole reason a lot of people liked it was because it was different from the home base, different wall types, different troop types, but now its just exactly the same as the home base, with a few minor tweaks. BUT I love how this game does not pay to win, it's pay to progress, so you can get just as good as someone else who spent money, they just will be in a higher league for a while. But there are NO ads, whatsoever.\", \"Will always be Supercell's best game. Can never truly step away from it. Sure, it can get boring and slow at times, but for 2-3 years of free to play, you'll always have something to do. If you buy just some small deals here and there, it makes it a game you can play more frequently. I log in maybe twice a day just to attack and upgrade and always passes the time.\", \"Hi Devs! Please consider creating a feature to have saved clan castle reinforcements so you don't have to delete the previous troops because of a change in attack strategy. Also it would be nice to see a change in the wall placing system. Anytime you try and move a wall segment, it swaps the pieces and makes it really frustrating to move wall segments.\", \"Lovely game, there's enough stuff to be able to spend a ton of time, but you can also just pop in, change something, and pop out. The game is definitely way too long nowadays, if you are picking this up as a new player don't expect to ever finish it, but CoC had its peak time. There needs to be new content for the maxed players, but I think that adding more town hall levels is just absurd with how long the game is already.\", \"An amazing game where you progress through different town halls whilst unlocking new troops, spells, and buildings. The only complaint I have is once you get to around town hall 12 the time it takes to upgrade things is way to much. It makes the game a lot less fun because your mostly waiting. But other than that its a great strategy game and I highly recommend it to anyone who's into strategy! 😆\", \"The builder base is garbage. It was great playing much like the regular base, but making you be a little more tactical and precise with your attacks. Now supercell really dropped the ball redesigning the way it's played. The mechanics of it feel just disgusting now. Adding a second stage and more to it is great, but why did they have to change the way it was played. I love clash, and hopefully enough passionate players feel the same about the new update, and they fix what they just screwed up.\", \"The new Builder's Hall part of the game is cool. But it takes soooo long to match with an attack. It reminds me of dial-up internet access. 🤦🏼 It often takes longer to find you an opponent than it does to complete the attacks. Seems to maybe be my connection through WiFi. When switched to cellular, selection is faster.\", \"This game has been with me sence about 2013 yet with my current device, which yes, has a low-ish storage space, but nonetheless I have to remove several apps just to install updates. As well as, every single time I've attacked another base I'd get maybe two stars into the fight then the game will crash it is insane that I've had to go through this process, I cannot attack at all, it's very hard to understand why this process happens all the time. Thank you.\", \"This is an easy 5 star. This game has been one of my favorite games for years. It's so exciting because you just feel the action and destruction everytime you attack a village or in a war. I never get bored of this, although upgrading defenses and walls is extremely difficult and expensive, it's still a very interesting and fantastic experience. The most relaxing and satsfying thing is that it has ZERO ads, which is really amazing and relaxing for me not to try skipping any ad.\", 'No forced ads. There is a gem system, and you can pay for it, but you can earn gyms passively and consistently through achievements and clearing bushes from your base. The battles are fun, and you are constantly upgrading your base and characters. They added a second base (builder base) with a slightly different and faster paced playstyle as well. The only negative thing I can say is that the game feels a bit easy now as opposed to 10 years ago when i used to play, still solid game though 5*', \"Is there anyway that players could get a landscape design without spending cash. Like some challenges or X amount of gems. I really wanted to have sceneries but since I'm still a student, i can't buy. But still, issues are fixed and there's so much things you could do now while in game. Good graphics still and new heroes, potions, and buildings. Hope to reduce building time because some buildings took weeks to finish..\", \"Super Goblins were the best addition to the game, providing players, who aren't as good strategically, to advance in their own way. In the same way, the new builder base update destroyed the simplicity of the attacking system. I was playing it dailly using the cannon carts and slowly but steadily making progress. After the update, I got the 9 star bonus once and probably won't play again, until it is changed in a way, that let's me enjoy playing it again. Sometimes less is more!!!\", 'Overall, the game is pretty good, i have been playing it for about 2-3 years now, but im starting to lose interest in it cause of how long the upgrading mechanic takes, most of the time the upgrades are about 2 - 1 week long, and is there any way we can unlock the sceneries without spending money? Like maybe a event or something. Overall, a pretty good game but not reccomended for people who are impatient.', \"I've been playing Clash for the better part of 11 years now and I absolutely love the game. Everything from the mechanics to the aesthetic. I do have one major issue that seems to have been cropping up recently. 95% of the time my Electro Dragons turn away from the enemy's Town Hall, and right infront of it too, costing me stars and trophies. It was never an issue before the release of the Stage Battles were brought out for Builder Base. Please look into and fix this bug.\", \"It's a pretty good game and I've been playing it for so long. There was never anything wrong with the game except for longer upgrade time at higher town Hall's which is to be expected. But recently, whenever I play the game, sometimes, while attacking opponents, the zoom in and zoom out gestures gets reversed and I am not able to deploy the troops. It lasts for only for a few seconds, but in games like COC, few seconds can lead to many changes\", \"Played in 2015 till 2017. Got away from the game because it became too repititive and boring, on top of that, the cost and upgrade time was too much. Played again in 2020 for a while and noticed a lot of improvement but stopped at the same year due to busy with work. Played again now in 2023 and absolutely love all the addition, improvement and upgrades to the game. Now addicted again. Love how the game is not pay to win and it's optional if you want to improve your experience through cash.\", 'I had a great experience playing the game. However, last update completely overhauled the interface design... Now i cannot see the maximum possible update of buildings in the main town... i used that information to plan how investing ressources, but now i cannot would really love if you could add it to the new interface.', 'Enjoyable but... Building take so long to build it\\'s forcing you to spend money, which isn\\'t an issue but to become \\'the best\\' you are required to spend a fair bit of cash, which isn\\'t great... Maybe some sort of month subscription could be introduced which give you \"X amount of times for a month\" and you can still purchase more on top if you wished too. Overall it\\'s a good game if patient enough to build your clan on a cheaper budget.', \"Font size got decreased alot,, do need increase it. As I am playing it's not looking good with smaller fonts. And one more suggestion, please do not make anything extra bases in the game as it's getting more confusing and we feel like what we need to play...nd consuming lot of storage also, this will lead me to un install the game as I am playing since 5 years..\", \"I've been trying to buy a cheap pack (to avoid waiting on the game) for hours! Wfter jumping through loops and registering a code word to my credit card, finally bought (twice, as it's very easy to mistakenly make a double purchase) I'm still unable to get my pack!!!!. Still 'waiting', nobody to help or to answer! Horrible frustrating experience!!!!!!\", 'Been playing on and off for the last few years. Very little has changed. Same characters, same stuff to do, but nice game to burn time. Only drawback is that it would be great if there were templates to use for base design instead of having to design your own. Really becomes a pain when you get over level 8.', \"The play experience of the same itself, that is very, very good I would rate 5 stars if that was the only thing I was going off. But as fun as this game is. After just 1 minute of playtime the game just goes black. nothing on my screen except black, and the only way I can keep playing is by restarting the game. If this issue is fixed then I'll update my review to 5 stars. Edit: It was fixed. Thankyou Supercell, now you get 5 stars from me.\", \"Clash of Clans is a fun, quite addicting game that really takes a lot of time and effort but has fast paced, strategic battle elements. If you can either ignore of bear with long waiting times for upgrades or building, I highly recommend this game. If you can't deal with those, this game maybe isn't for you, unless you think the game makes up for it in the battle and village defence. I think it's worth at least trying the tutorial, as it's very short and gives you a decent overview of the game.\", 'Logged in today after a long time. The new events and stuff are really good. But right after logging in I have encountered 2 problems. While trying to login using supercell account it often takes too long to send verification code. The more annoying thing is the new button adjustments in upgrades. Why did you add \"confirm magic items\" instead of the resources option first thing after clicking upgrade. I was trying to upgrade my walls and instead of resources used up walls rings accidentally.', 'This game is way too good! Has nice graphics and is a really fun strategy game. I love how you actually need to use your brain and thinking but you only have 30 seconds to brain storm before the battle starts. Really nice idea. Also I just love the amount of updates and content that this game puts out. It even has its own show! And the advertising is great! This game is definitely a 10 out of 10.', \"The update a few months ago fixed the crashing issues. I almost gave up. You guys fixed it at the last minute, I was so excited. I was back to playing this game daily and spending money. Well the upgrade yesterday just made it start crashing. I'm disappointed, had it perfect. Now I'm debating getting ride of my account I have had since 2015. Nothing worse that the game crashing mid war or battle. All them millions and still cant figure it out. Put me on the payroll. I would fix week 1 smh\", 'It is a very good game to play Where we need to build our base to protect from enemies and you can also attack on the enemy base but first you need to train your troops. Whenever you level up there is a new class of adventure. It becomes more and more interesting when you level up. And there are clans where you can join and attack together with your clan members.', \"Application crashes all the time especially when I click on attack in Legend League. When not in Legend league, finding opponents was taking more than 5 minutes of loading. Developers are slacking or what?, I don't even get my missed attacks back. Add some backend cron job to look for such failures to give me my attack counts back.\", \"The main game is fun and they have made it alot better over the years. The builder base wich is separate from the main base is wildly unbalanced. It feels like it's impossible to get gold. Even if you miraculously 3 Star a base it only gives a measly amount of gold. You have to grind so much for 1 upgrade and attacking is so hard because the tiny amount of troops you are allowed to bring die so fast to the defenses. So actually 3 staring a base is rare, at least at the lower levels.\", 'This game is so much fun and interesting. The attack strategies, gaming system everything is awesome. But sometimes my screen turn black. The game is on, sound, touch everything but the screen turn black. Nowadays it is happening frequently when I enter the game. If you see into this matter it would be great I think.', 'The best strategic game , needs great planning , execution , reflexes and skillz , really love this game , new builder base update is just awsome!! , please make the magic items to become available a tad more easy and reduce upgrade amount for heroes a bit , upgrade timer for heroes is not much of a matter of concern but that amount...especially at higher town hall levels', \"I'm back from a 2 to 3 year hiatus. I've noticed you don't need elixir to train troops anymore. I feel as if it defeats the purpose of the game. Now, managing your base is easier than ever. Striving for gold to upgrade something really expensive was the fun part. Everything is more or less handed to you on a silver platter.\", \"Very Nice👍 It's fun, but you could actually add some new features like day to night transition. Yk, it's always day. What you could do is that you could add an afternoon phase with that yellowish orange afternoon light, and add a nighttime, which might require some different tasks. Also the production buildings and materials get sooooo expensive at a point, it makes us lose interest.\", \"Pretty good game. But no way should 1 upgrade take a week, that's absolutely ridiculous. Personally it makes me lose interest in the game entirely. Especially when you level up and placed in a new bracket, now you're facing people whom have their bases maxed out. To compete with them you either wait a year or whip out your visa. Also it seems like troops try to attack anything but the base, even if they're directly in front of it.\", \"I really enjoy the game it's fun and unique but sadly a game can't be perfect 😔 the walls can be too expensive not to mention the long hours or days you have to wait. I really don't have a problem waiting but it becomes a little annoying when you have to wait 5 or 6 day for one upgrade. I suggest you make builders potion more common or reduce the amount of time it takes to finish an upgrade. Other than that i really thank the developers for giving us such a good game, 5⭐\"]), ('appId', 'com.supercell.clashofclans'), ('url', 'https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.supercell.clashofclans&hl=en&gl=us')]\n"
